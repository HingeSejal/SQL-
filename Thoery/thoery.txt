GROUP BY -result is determined by the unique vls of grped cls
---------------------
ORDER By -to sort the data in asc and desc order
--------------------
we use AS-ALIAS in the aggregate fun to name new col after summing up (sum(col))
----------------------
select country , 
       sum(score) as total_score ,
       count(id) as total_customers
from customers
where score>400
group by country
having sum(score) > 800

 the syntax goes like
 0. in where we filter before aggregating fun
 1. in group by u should write the selected col
 2. while writing having we write condition using aggregated fun

 BEFORE aggregation - where
 AFTER aggregation - having
 --------------------------

 Distinct - Remove Duplication , each val appears once only
select distinct country from customers 
---> will give country name only once

Top - to get top few rows
select top 3 * from table 

-----------------------------

select country , avg(score) as avg_score 
from customers
where score!=0
group by country 
having avg(score)>430 
order by country asc ;


execution order => 
from -> where -> grp by -> having -> select distinct -> order by -> top

-------------------------------
SET - we join data one after another like stack
JOIN - we combine data/cols horizontaly

TYPES OF SET------
union
union all
except
intersect

TYPES OF JOINS-----
1] Basic JOIN
no join - nothing is common
inner join - common in both A and B
full join  - both A nd B 
left join  - left col + B's common part
right join - right col + A's common part

2] Advanced JOIN
left anti join
right anti join
full anti join
cross join

USE OF JOINS-------
1.Data enrichment - getting extra data
2.Recombine data - big picture
3.checking existance- filtering

-----------------------------

if u alter the table sequence in (from  and join) in left join u will get right join

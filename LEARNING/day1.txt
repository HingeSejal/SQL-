GROUP BY -result is determined by the unique vls of grped cls
---------------------
ORDER By -to sort the data in asc and desc order
--------------------
we use AS-ALIAS in the aggregate fun to name new col after summing up (sum(col))
----------------------
select country , 
       sum(score) as total_score ,
       count(id) as total_customers
from customers
where score>400
group by country
having sum(score) > 800

 the syntax goes like
 0. in where we filter before aggregating fun
 1. in group by u should write the selected col
 2. while writing having we write condition using aggregated fun

 BEFORE aggregation - where
 AFTER aggregation - having
